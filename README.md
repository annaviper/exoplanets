# Overview

* What data/business/research/personal question you would like to answer? Make sure the question description is human-friendly because you will have non-tech audience to see your final project presentation.

* Did you understand the context for the question and the scientific or business application?

* What is the hypothesis you would like to test in order to answer your question? Frame your hypothesis with statistical/data languages (i.e. define Null and Alternative Hypothesis). You can use formulas if you want but that is not required.

* Did you consider whether the question could be answered with the available data?

* How will you test your hypothesis?

* How will you test your success?

# Data preparation

* What is your dataset about?

* Where/how did you obtain your dataset? It can be either a public dataset or collected with API/web scraping. Provide a link if possible.

* General description of the dataset such as the size, complexity, data types, etc.

# Data Ingestion & Database

* If you downloaded a dataset (either public or private), describe where you downloaded it and include the command to load the dataset.

* Provide a schema of your tables.

# Data Wrangling and Cleaning

* Print charts to demonstrate the effect of your work. Charts make your presentation look good too.

* If you use ML in your final project, also describe your feature selection process.

# Model Training and Evaluation

* Train your ML model, produce results, and evaluate.

* This is an iterative process. Try your best to improve your model performance by:

* Try different models and select one that is the simplest yet produce the best result.

* Try advanced techniques and see if they improve the result.

# Conclusion

* Summarize your data analysis result.

* State your conclusion of your hypothesis testing.

* Interpret your findings in terms of the human-understandable question you try to answer.

# What are the next steps?
