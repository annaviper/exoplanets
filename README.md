# Final project

## Project Goals

Knowing that the ice sheet estension in the Arctic is decreasing but the polar bears population is stable, we want to test the hypothesis that the population of animals depending on sea ice is stable because they are moving to higher latitudes, in this case, the polar bears and ringed seals in the area of Svalbard. 


* Do the e2e analysis by your own.
* Give some insights about a topic of your choice giving some arguments by:
  * Being able to transmit the analysis in an ordered way.
  * Using the statistical techniques learnt during the last weeks.
  * Plotting the graphs in a useful way for the reader / listener. Yes, no additional rules Jordi.
* Present your analysis in two ways and for two different audiencies:
  * Technical audience: you will present a paper.
  * Non tech audience: you will do a short presentation.


## Datasets
* A notebook with your analysis in a paper way. Jupyter or Zeppelin are allowed.
* A 3' presentation in the auditorium.
* Repository with your workflow + documentation + code. Even if you are working alone, you need to keep good practices!
